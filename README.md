# Live Project 1

<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>This page functions as a summary of the first live project I completed through The Tech Academy. The goal of this project was to provide me with real-world technical experience, and for me to show off some of the skills I've learned so far. During this project, I worked with a team to create apps using the Django framework (version 2.2) that will help users keep track of various collectible items. For my app, I chose to develop a program capable of keeping track of a collection of cards for a popular trading card game, Hearthstone. This project included three main parts, which I will provide details on below.</p>
